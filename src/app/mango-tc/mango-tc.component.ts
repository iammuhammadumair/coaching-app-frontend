  Account Holder, the beneficial owners, or a specific Payment Operation.`, `
  4.2.2. Restriction of the Payment Account`, `
  By the Service Provider’s free assessment, use of a Payment Account may be restricted without the Service
  Provider having to justify their decision to the Account Holder in question. The functioning of the Payment

  The Service Provider, without motivation, or right to an indemnity in favour of the Account Holder, may
  refuse a request to open an Account. This refusal will be indicated to the Account Holder by the Platform
  by any means under the terms established on the Site.`, `
  5. Functioning of the Payment Account`, `
  The amounts credited to the Payment Account result from the funds transferred by Card (or by any other
  Payment Method accepted by the Service Provider), or the receipt of a transfer. The amounts debited from
  the Payment Account result: from executing a Payment Order to an account opened in the books of a ThirdParty Payment Service Provider, of the Service Provider withdrawing fees due by the Account Holder under
  the Framework Contract or, a reversal of an operation by Card (or by any other Payment Method).`, `
  5.1.Acceptance of Payment Orders by Card for the Payment Account`, `
  Transactions for the Payment Account may be carried out by Card (or any other method accepted by the
  Service Provider), once or on several occasions. When such an operation is requested, the User will be
  identified on the Site by indicating their username (valid email address) and their password or via their
  Facebook account. The funds transfer request will be indicated on the Payment Page dedicated for this
  purpose. For all payments, the User may be requested to use a one-time code sent to their mobile telephone
  to the institution that issued the Card. If this is the case, it is the Service Provider’s right to refuse any
  payment following their free assessment without this decision giving rise to any indemnification. The funds
  transfer operation is carried out by the institution that issued the Card. Any dispute for such a transfer must
  be indicated to this institution. The Service Provider is not authorised to cancel such a transfer.
  The Account Holder is informed that the Service Provider accepting a Payment Order by Card does not
  guarantee the receipt of these funds by the Account Holder in their Account. The funds arriving in the
  Payment Account of the Account Holder is based on the effective receipt by the Service Provider of the
  funds collected less the fees agreed to under the Price Conditions.
  If the funds are not received for technical reasons, the Service Provider will make their best efforts to settle
  the operation. If the funds are not received for any other reason, the Service Provider will immediately
  inform the Account Holder of their inability to credit their Account in the expected amount, and to contact
  the User.
  In the event that the transfer of funds to the Account of the Account Holder is cancelled by the institution
  issuing the Card following the User disputing it, the Account Holder accepts that the Service Provider may
  reverse any funds transfer operation by Card by debiting the Payment Account of the corresponding amount.
  The Account Holder recognises that such dispute may be brought to the attention of the institution issuing
  the Card up until a maximum time frame of thirteen (13) months following the date that the account was
  debited related to said Card. In the absence of sufficient provisions in the Account to carry out such a
  reversal, the Service Provider may suspend or cancel any Payment Operation initiated by the Account
  Holder or a representative, or as the case may be, subrogate the rights of the Account Holder by carrying
  out recovery procedures for the amount due by the User by any means.`, `
  5.2.Receipt of Transfer to the Payment Account`, `
  The Account Holder authorises the Service Provider to receive in their Payment Account SEPA transfer
  operations in euros from a bank account or payment account open in the books of a Third-Party PSP.
  The funds are credited to the Payment Account by the Service Provider as quickly as possible following
  their effective receipt by the Service Provider.
  After the funds are credited to the Account Holder’s Payment Account, the Service Provider will make
  available a summary of the transfer operation received, including the following information: the reference
  number of the payment operation, a reference number allowing identification of the payer, the amount of
  the operation, the date of the credit value.`, `
  5.3.Execution of a Wire Transfer Operation Debited from the Payment Account`, `
  The Account Holder may transfer orders for SEPA or international wire transfers to a Beneficiary’s account
  held by a Third-Party PSP.
  When the Account Holder wishes to carry out a Transfer Operation, they will indicate their identification in
  their Personal Online Area by indicating their Identification Data and, if need be, by following a Strong
  Authentication procedure if indicated to them. They will indicate on the Payment Page: the amount of the
  Payment Operation, the currency, the Payment Account to be debited, the date the Order is to be placed and
  any other required information. In the absence of a date indicated, the Transfer Order will be deemed to be
  placed immediately. The Account Holder must also follow the Authentication Procedure (or follow the
  Strong Authentication Procedure) indicated by the Service Provider.
  The Account Holder may at any time issue a request to execute a Transfer Order to a Beneficiary designated
  by them that has a bank account or payment account from a Third-Party Payment Service Provider. The
  Account Holder must include the subject associated with each transfer by respecting the Authentication
  Procedure (or Strong Authentication Procedure, if it be the case) indicated by the Service Provider
  The Account Holder irrevocably consents to the Payment Order by clicking on the “validation” button
  (“Date of Receipt”). The receipt of the Payment Order is confirmed in the Account Holder’s Personal Online
  Area. No Order may be withdrawn by the Account Holder after the date upon which it is deemed to
  irrevocably have been received, which is from the Date of Receipt.
  Before issuing a Transfer Order, the Account Holder (or the Platform acting on their behalf) must ensure
  that they have a sufficient amount of credit available in their Account to cover the amount of the Payment
  Operation and the related fees as established in the Price Conditions. If necessary, they must credit their
  Account before the Order is validly transferred to the Service Provider to carry it out.
  It is expressly agreed that the Payment Orders are executed at the latest at the end of the Business Day
  following the Date of Receipt of the Order by the Service Provider (and on the agreed-to execution date for
  standing or timely transfers). Any Payment Order received after 4:00 p.m. by the Service Provider will be
  deemed to have been received the following Business Day. If the Date of Receipt is not a Business Day, the
  Payment Order will be deemed to have been received the following Business Day.
  For each Transfer Operation, the Account Holder may request from the Service Provider to be provided
  with a Hard Copy of the information related to the maximum execution time frame of this specific operation,
  the fees that they owe and, if it be the case, the details regarding these fees.
  The Service Provider may be required to refuse to execute a Transfer Order that is incomplete or erroneous.
  The Account Holder must reissue the Order so that it is in proper conformity. Furthermore, the Service
  Provider may block a Transfer Order in the event of serious doubt regarding fraudulent use of the Account,
  unauthorised use of the Account, breach of security of the Account, in the event of a freeze issued by an
  administrative authority or for any other reason.
  In the event a Transfer Order is refused or blocked, the Service Provider will inform the Account Holder
  thereof by any means. If possible, the Service Provider will indicate to the Account Holder the reasons for
  this refusal or blockage, unless it is prohibited from doing so due to a pertinent provision of national law or
  European Union law.`, `
  5.4.Reimbursement`, `
  The Account Holder may at any time transfer instructions to cancel a transfer of funds in order to reimburse
  a User. The Account Holder will access the Site indicating their identifier and password. They will indicate,
  in their Personal Online Area, the amount of the reimbursement, the currency, the User to be reimbursed
  and any other required information.
  The reimbursement operation is carried out by the Service Provider by crediting the Card used by the User
  or by transfer using the original payment methods, within the limit of the available balance in the Account
  and the rules for each network and SEPA rules within five (5) Business Days following the Service
  Provider’s receipt of the request for reimbursement.`, `
  5.5.Specific Provisions for Services Initiating Payment and Information on Accounts Provided by
  Third-Party PSP`, `
  When a Wire Transfer Order is consented to by a Third-Party PSP offering the services of initiating
  payment, this consent is agreed to between the Account Holder and said Third-Party PSP under the
  conditions agreed to between them. The Service Provider is not involved under these conditions and
  may in no way be held responsible in the event of a dispute related to providing this service by the
  Third-Party PSP following said conditions.
  The Account Holder may not revoke a payment order after giving their consent that the Third-Party PSP
  providing the service of initiating payment initiates the Payment Operation.
  If an unauthorised, unexecuted or improperly executed Payment Operation is initiated by the Third-Party
  PSP providing the service of initiating payment, the Service Provider, at the latest at the end of the following
  Business Day, shall immediately reimburse the Account Holder in the amount of the unauthorised,
  unexecuted or improperly executed operation and, if it be the case, refund the Account debited so that it is
  in the state that it would be in if the unauthorised or improperly executed Payment Operation had not taken
  place. The date on which the Account Holder’s Payment Account is credited shall not be dated later than
  the date upon which it was debited.`, `
  6. Reporting`, `
  The Account Holder, in their Personal Online Area, has a statement of the Payment Operations carried out
  on the Payment Account available to them. They are asked to attentively acknowledge the list of these
  operations. Operations statements may also, upon express request, be made available to the professional
  Account Holder for other time frames.
  It is specified that for each Transfer Operation carried out by the Service Provider, the Account Holder has
  the following information available to them: the reference number of the Operation, the identification of the
  Beneficiary, the amount of the Operation, the date the Order is received, and if it be the case, the fees related
  to executing this Operation.`, `
  7. Access to the Payment Account and Confidentiality of Personalised Security Data`, `
  The Payment Account is accessible online in the Personal Online Area, by using the Identification Data and
  in compliance with the requested Authentication Procedure (or Strong Authentication Procedure, depending
  on the case).
  The Account Holder must indicate the Identification Data of each Authorised Person. Each Authorised
  Person accepts to not use the name or Identification Data of another person. The Account Holder alone is
  responsible for the use of their identifier.
  Each Authorised Person is fully responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their Identification Data,
  as well as any other Personalised Security Data potentially provided to the Service Provider or the Platform.
  The Account Holder must take all reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality and security of their
  Personalised Security Data. They also undertake to educate the Authorised Persons regarding the
  confidentiality and security of their own Personalised Security Data.
  The Account Holder (and each Authorised Person) accepts to not communicate their Personalised Security
  Data to third parties. By way of exception, the Account Holder may communicate to authorised Third-Party
  PSP in a Member State of the European Union or in a State that is part of the European Economic Area
  agreement for information services regarding the accounts and initiation of Payment Operation (such as
  defined in Article 4 of European Directive 2015/2366, called “PSD2”). The Account Holder must ensure
  that this Third-Party PSP is authorised for the above-mentioned services and that it accesses the Personalised
  Security Data in a secured environment.`, `
  8. Objection Regarding Personalised Security Data`, `
  The Account Holder must inform the Platform of the loss or theft of their Personalised Security Data, of
  any misuse or unauthorised use of their Personal Online Area or data relating to them as soon as they become
  aware of this and request that it be blocked. This declaration must be carried out:
  - by making a telephone call to the Platform Customer Service at the number indicated in the General
  Conditions of the Site; or
  - directly by electronic message through the contact form accessible on the Site.
  The Service Provider, through the Platform, shall immediately execute the request for objection. The event
  will be recorded and date/time stamped. An objection number with date/time stamp will be provided to the
  Account Holder. Written confirmation of this objection will be sent by the Platform to the Account Holder
  in question by electronic message. The Service Provider will take administrative responsibility of the file
  and keep all proof relating to it for 18 (eighteen) months. Upon written request of the Account Holder and
  before this time frame expires, the Service Provider will provide a copy of this objection.
  Any request for objection must be confirmed immediately by the Account Holder in question, by a letter
  signed by the latter, provided or sent by registered mail, or email, to the Service Provider at the postal
  address indicated hereinabove or at the address indicated in the General Conditions of the Site.

  the Platform. In the event Personalised Security Data is stolen or there is fraudulent use of the Personal
  Online Area, the Service Provider is authorised to request from the Platform, a statement or copy of the
  complaint of the Account Holder and undertakes to respond to it as quickly as possible.`, `
  9. Blocking a Payment Account and Refusing Access to a Payment Account`, `

  Third-Party PSP providing the service of initiating payment or information on the accounts, for objectively
  motivated or documented reasons related to unauthorised or fraudulent access to the Payment Account by
  this Service Provider, including initiating an unauthorised or fraudulent payment operation.
  In this event, the Account Holder will be informed in their Personal Online Area of the block or refusal of
  access to the Payment Account and the reasons for this block or refusal. This information will be provided
  to them, if possible, before the Payment Account is blocked or access is refused and at the latest immediately
  after the block or refusal, unless providing this information is not communicable for reasons of objectively
  motivated security or is prohibited under another provision of pertinent European Union or national law.
  The Service Provider will unblock the Account or re-establish access to it when the reasons for the block or
  refusal of access no longer exist. The Account Holder may request at any time that the Account be unblocked
  by indicating this to the Platform Customer Service, the contact information of which is included in the

  being their responsibility to contest it to the Service Provider as soon as possible. Unless there are good
  reasons to suspect the Account Holder of fraud, the Service Provider will reimburse the Account Holder in
  the amount of the Operation immediately following receiving the request to contest it, and in any case at the
  latest at the end of the next Business Day. The Service Provider will return the Account to the state it was
  in before the unauthorised Payment Operation took place
  In the event of the loss or theft of Personalised Security Data, unauthorised Operations carried out before
  they are contested are the Account Holder’s responsibility. Operations carried out after they are contested
  are borne by the Service Provider unless in the event of fraud by the Account Holder.`, `
  10.3. Provisions Applicable to Consumer Account Holders`, `
  Consumer Account Holders wishing to contest a Transfer Operation unauthorised by them or improperly
  executed must contact the Platform Customer Service by telephone as soon as possible after they become
  aware of the anomaly and at the latest within thirteen (13) months following the date it is debited, it being
  their responsibility to contest it to the Service Provider as soon as possible. Unless there are good reasons
  to suspect the Account Holder of fraud, the Service Provider will reimburse the Account Holder in the
  amount of the Operation immediately following receiving the request to contest it, and in any case at the
  latest at the end of the next Business Day. The Service Provider will return the Account to the state it was
  in before the unauthorised Payment Operation took place
  In the event it is contested, responsibility for proof that the Operation was identified, duly recorded and
  accounted for, and that it was not affected by technical or other deficiencies is the responsibility of the
  Service Provider.
  In the event of an unauthorised Payment Operation following the loss or theft of Personalised Security Data,
  the Account Holder is responsible for the losses related to the use of Personalised Security Data before it is
  contested, up to a threshold of fifty (50) euros. Operations carried out after they are contested are borne by
  the Service Provider unless in the event of fraud by the Account Holder. However, the Account Holder is
  not held responsible in the event:
  - Of an unauthorised Payment Operation carried out without using Personalised Security Data;
  - Of the loss or theft of Personalised Security Data that could not be detected by the Account Holder
  before the payment was made;
  - Of losses due to actions or failures of an employee, agent or subsidiary of a PSP or an entity to
  which these activities were externalised.
  The Account Holder is also not held responsible:
  - if the unauthorised Payment Operation is carried out by diverting the Personalised Security Data,
  without the Account Holder’s knowledge;
  - in the event of counterfeiting the Personalised Security Data, if, at the time of the unauthorised
  Payment Operation, the Account Holder is in possession of this Data.
  The Account Holder will bear all the losses arising from unauthorised Operations if these losses result from
  fraudulent activity by them or if they intentionally seriously neglected the obligations to keep their
  Personalised Security Data secured and to contest operations in the event of loss, theft or diversion of their
  Data.
  Barring fraudulent activities on behalf of the Account Holder, the latter will not bear any financial
  consequences if the unauthorised Operation was carried out without the Service Provider requiring Strong
  Authentication of the Account Holder, in the event that regulations require it.`, `
  11. Financial Conditions`, `
  The services offered herein are invoiced by the Platform on behalf of the Service Provider in compliance
  with the Price Conditions.
  Any commissions due by the Account Holder are automatically deducted from the Payment Account by the
  Service Provider. The Account Holder authorises the Service Provider to compensate at any time, even after
  the Account is closed, any irrefutable credit, liquid and collectible that remains owed, of any nature
  whatsoever. Funds in the Payment Account may be compensated for any amount due, collectible and unpaid
  of the Account Holder to the Service Provider.
  In the event of late payment of the amounts due and collectible of the Account Holder to the Service
  Provider, the Account Holder will owe late-payment interests for the period from the date they are due until
  payment is complete. The applicable interest rate will be calculated on the basis of two times the annual
  legal interest rate published twice yearly for businesses. The amount of late-payment interest will be equal
  to the product of the amount unpaid multiplied by the above-mentioned legal interest rate and the number
  of days late over 365.`, `
  12. Term and Termination`, `
  The Framework Contract is entered into for an indeterminate period. It enters into force from the time it is
  accepted by the Account Holder.
  The latter may at any time and by respecting an advance notice of thirty (30) calendar days, terminate the
  Framework Contract. The Service Provider may at any time terminate the Framework Contract, by
  respecting an advance notice of two (2) months provided in Hard Copy format. In this case, the fees
  irrefutably owed for the Payment Services are due by the Account Holder on a pro rata basis for the period
  elapsed at the termination date.
  Beyond six (6) months, the Framework Contract may be terminated without costs. In other cases,
  termination costs may apply, in compliance with the Price Conditions.
  For these purposes, each Party must notify the termination hereof to the other Party, by registered letter with
  acknowledgment of receipt, to the postal and email address indicated in the General Conditions of the Site.
  Consequently, the entire Framework Contract is terminated any Payment Account is closed. The credit in
  the Account will be transferred in a time frame of thirteen (13) months to the Account Holder’s Bank
  Account after deducting the fees due and payable to the Service Provider. If the credit in the Payment
  Account surpasses the threshold indicated in the Price Conditions, the amount surpassing the threshold will
  be transferred within thirty (30) days following the date the termination takes effect to the Account Holder’s
  bank account after deducting the fees due and payable to the Service Provider. The Service Provided is
  discharged of any obligation upon confirming to the Account Holder the transfer to the bank account
  indicated.
  In the event of serious breach, fraud, or lack of payment on the part of the Account Holder, the Service
  Provider reserves the right to suspend or terminate this Contract by sending an email along with a registered
  letter with acknowledgment of receipt without providing reasons or advance notice.
  It is established that the Framework Contract will be automatically terminated in the event of new
  circumstances that affect the ability of a Party to carry out the obligations of the Contract.`, `
  13. Modification of the Contract`, `
  The Service Provider reserves the right, at any time, to modify the Framework Contract. Any draft
  modification of the Framework Contract is provided to the Account Holder via the Platform
  Any Account Holder may refuse the proposed modifications and must notify their refusal to the Platform
  Customer Service by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt two (2) months before the proposed
  modifications enter into force (post office stamp being proof thereof) to the address indicated in the General
  Conditions of the Site.
  Lacking notification of refusal before the indicated date that they enter into force, the Account Holder will
  be deemed to have accepted the proposed modifications. The relationship between the Parties after the date
  of entry into force will then be governed by the new version of the Framework Contract.
  In the event the Account Holder refuses, this refusal will give rise, without fees, to the termination of the
  Framework Contract, as well as the transfer of the balance of the Payment Account in a time frame of
  thirteen (13) months following the date the termination takes effect in order to cover anything contested in
  the future.
  Any legislative or regulatory provisions that make modifications necessary to any part of the Framework
  Contract will be applicable from the date they enter into force, without advance notice. However, the
  Account Holder will be informed thereof.`, `
  14. Security`, `
  The Service Provider undertakes to ensure that the services are provided with respect to the applicable laws
  and regulations and best practices. Specifically, the Service Provider shall do what is necessary to ensure
  the security and confidentiality of the Account Holder’s data, in compliance with the regulation in force.
  The Service Provider reserves the right to temporarily suspend access to the online Account for technical,
  security or maintenance reasons without these operations invoking any right to an indemnity of any kind. It
  undertakes to limit these types of interruptions to those that are strictly necessary.
  However, the Service Provider shall not be held responsible to the Account Holder for potential errors,
  omissions, interruptions or delays of operations carried out via the Site that result from unauthorised access
  by the latter. The Service Provider shall not be held responsible for the theft, destruction or unauthorised
  disclosure of data that results from unauthorised access to the Site. Furthermore, the Service Provider
  remains outside of the scope of the legal relationship between the Account Holder and a User or between
  the Account Holder and the Site. The Service Provider will not be held responsible for defaults, breaches or
  negligence between a User and an Account Holder, or the Site and an Account Holder.
  If the unique identifier or any other information necessary to carry out a Payment Operation provided by
  the Account Holder is inexact, the Service Provider cannot be held responsible for the improper execution
  of said Service.
  The Platform alone is responsible for the security and confidentiality of the data exchanged in the framework
  of using the Site in compliance with the General Conditions of the Site, the Service Provider being
  responsible for the security and confidentiality of the data that it exchanges with the Account Holder in the
  framework hereof for creating and managing their Account, as well as Payment Operations related to the
  Account.`, `
  15. Limits to the Service Provider’s Liability`, `
  The Service Provider is in no way involved in the legal and commercial relationships and potential disputes
  arising between the Account Holder and the User or between the Account Holder and the Platform or
  between the Account Holder and a Beneficiary. The Service Provider exercises no oversight over the
  conformity, security, legality, characteristics and the appropriate character of the products and services
  subject to a Payment Operation.
  Every operation carried out by the Account Holder gives rise to a contract created directly between
  themselves and a User who is a stranger to the Service Provider. Consequently, the latter cannot be held
  responsible for the non-performance or improper performance of the obligations arising from it, or any
  potential damages caused to the Account Holder.
  Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Contract, the Service Provider’s liability in terms of an
  Account Holder is limited to reparations for direct damages as established by regulation.`, `
  16. The Account Holder’s Commitments`, `
  The Account Holder acknowledges that elements in their Personal Online Area do not infringe on the rights
  of a third party and are not contrary to the law, public order, or proper ethics.
  They undertake:
  (i) To not perform the Framework Contract in an illegal manner or under conditions that may
  damage, deactivate, overload or alter the site;
  (ii) To not usurp the identity of another person or entity, falsify or divulge their identity, their age
  or create a false identity;
  (iii) To not divulge data or personal information related to a third party, such as postal addresses,
  telephone numbers, email addresses, bank card numbers, etc. In the event of a breach of these
  obligations, the Service Provider may take all appropriate measures in order to bring an end to
  these actions. It also has the right to suspend, erase and/or block the Account Holder’s access
  to their Account.
  (iv) Without prejudice to legal actions undertaken by third parties, the Service Provider has the right
  to personally bring any legal action that seeks to repair the damages that it has personally been
  subject to due to the Account Holder’s breach of their obligations under this Contract.
  If the Account Holder is aware of a breach of the above-mentioned obligations, they are asked to inform the
  Service Provider of these actions by contacting it at the address: legal@mangopay.com.`, `

  Framework Contract is entered into. The Framework Contract may only be put into effect before the
  withdrawal deadline has expired upon the approval of the consumer Account Holder. The consumer Account
  Holder recognises that the use of Payment Services after entering into the Framework Contract constitutes
  an express request on its part to begin performing the Framework Contract before the above-mentioned
  deadline has expired. Exercising the right of withdrawal involves the Framework Contract coming to an
  end, and in the event performance thereof has begun, takes the form of termination and does not bring into
  question the services previously provided. In this event, the consumer Account Holder will only be
  responsible for a payment proportional to the Services effectively provided.`, `
  17.3. Exercising the Withdrawal Right`, `
  The Account Holder must notify the Platform Customer Service of their withdrawal request within the
